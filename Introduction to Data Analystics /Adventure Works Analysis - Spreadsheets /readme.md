### [Adventure Works Sales Analysis Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRYcSapO_W5zthyZE6LJrV_NJUuIqpg7Us1qs87hC-o/edit#gid=108409262)


## Utilising Spreadsheets for Data Analytics																						
In this spreadsheet you have:																									
- AdventureWorks.salesorderheader (with salesreasonID)																									
- AdventureWorks.salesreason																									
- AdventureWorks.employee (with contact data)																									
- AdventureWorks.SalesTerritory

Some of the redundant columns have been removed here (as opposed to the original SQL tables) to improve performance.			There still may be redundant columns in the data, it is up to you to choose what to use and what not.																						
### You've been tasked to populate the 'Overview' sheet with analytical insight:							
1. Business would like to see the monthly sales trend.										
2. They would also like to evaluate online vs non-online orders.																									
																
### It would be nice for businesses to have an overview of:																									
- The delivery performance trend (orderdate & Shipdate lag)																									
- Top salesperson by sales, by volume.																									
- Top countries.																									
- Top sales reasons																									
- Maybe you have an idea for a business that could be interesting to look into from this data?

- The technical part of the task should be followed by the analytical part, so use a structured approach to DA which you have learned in the first course. These are 6 steps you have to follow here:
1. Ask: what question do you have to answer to get a business value of the analysis?
2. Prepare: what data do you need to collect to answer your stated questions in the first step?
3. Process: store and clean your collected data. Check if it is correct.
4. Analyse: use analytical methods for analyses and reveal findings.
5. Share: present your insights.
6. Act: what changes have to be implemented according to your findings?

-A pivot table is used.	

-At least 3  Charts are used.

-Vlookup or match/index function is used.

-Data validation or conditional formatting is used.
